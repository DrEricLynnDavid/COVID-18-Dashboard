# COVID-18-Dashboard
An analytical dashboard for tracking U.S. COVID-19 statistics.
Last Updated: 6/24/2024. The following COVID-19-related data analysis and statistics pages were created for my original PhD dissertation topic before I changed it. I still maintain these pages on a monthly basis. The goal: to create distinct models that help grade, track, and forecast pandemic-related data. As of 2024 most data sources stopped reporting updated numbers. A final report will be forthcoming.
Because this is an Excel workbook, it may prompt security alerts depending on your version and security restrictions. There is no malicious content.
dashboard.xlsx is fairly straightforward in that it pulls via formulae from other tabs that used to have direct connections to global resource websites (nearly all have since stopped reporting their data - primarily due to the fact states and countries stopped consistently reporting their data)
covid_analysis.xlsx is the more detailed version of the dashboard and pulled from far more sources until they were discontinued.
These two works are meant for historical reference regarding, not just Covid-19, but how to measure responses to pandemics---as long as the data exists. From this work, I have spawned new measurement models that can apply to other fields.
